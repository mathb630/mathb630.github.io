        <p>My name is Bridget Mathis, a graduate student studying Urban Policy Analysis at The New School with a specialty in Data
        Visualization and Analytics. My primary areas of focus have revolved around criminal activity, as well as a focus on social justice.
        Given these areas of interest, I had developed an initial project looking at Twitter feed data, and aggregate it to establish
        non-reported areas of crime. It had examined common keywords in tweets, and overlayed them with typically high crime areas to
        see potential correlations. This project idea however began to be relatively problematic. Keyword searches are highly subject
        to bias, and perception is often a faulty indicator of crime. Not only does it become subject to income bias, it is highly
        prejudicial and based on racial or other ethnic preconceptions. With this said, there was naturally an inherent problem moving
        forward with this type of analysis.</p>
        
        <font size="4"><i>The Project</i></font>
        <p>That is where the new project, presented on this page, originated. With suggestion from my professor, I extracted 311 data
        and added extensive filtering for types of complaints that are more serious to public interest. As the dataset is incredibly large,
        data was limited to 2010 up until mid May 2017. Complaints such as asbestos, pests, radioactive activity, or so forth
        as demonstrated within the map.</p>
        
        <font size="4"><i>Methodology</i></font>
        <p>311 Data provides a myriad of opportunities for analysis. This project delves into examining different types of complaints
        and issues that exist in different areas throughout New York City, and conducts a cluster analysis of different complaint types
        within a chloropleth from Median Income Data. The intention and goal with this project is to examine the types of 
        complaints that exist with different levels of income. Particularly, there is a focus on looking at low income areas
        to see if there is a notable difference in the complaint types, and if there are clusters of public health issues in
        these areas.</p>
